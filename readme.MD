# Website Security Audit Playbook

This playbook provides a structured approach to auditing a website for security issues using tools like Nikto, Nmap, and vulnerability scanners.

## Step-by-Step Playbook

### 1. Preparation
- **Identify the target website**: Determine the domain or IP address of the website to be audited.
- **Gather necessary tools**: Ensure you have Nikto, Nmap, and a vulnerability scanner (e.g., Nessus) installed on your system.

### 2. Reconnaissance with Nmap
- **Scan for open ports and services**:
    ```sh
    nmap -sS -sV -O -p- <IP address>
    ```
    - `-sS`: TCP SYN scan.
    - `-sV`: Service version detection.
    - `-O`: OS detection.
    - `-p-`: Scan all ports.

- Save the scan results:
    ```sh
    nmap -sS -sV -O -p- -oN nmap_scan_results.txt <IP address>
    ```

### 3. Web Server Scanning with Nikto
- Run Nikto to scan the web server for vulnerabilities:
    ```sh
    nikto -h <IP address> -output nikto_scan_results.txt
    ```

### 4. Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
- Start Nessus service:
    ```sh
    sudo systemctl start nessusd
    ```
- Access Nessus web interface: Open a browser and go to `https://localhost:8834`.
- Create a new scan: Configure the target and start the scan.
- Export the scan results: Save the results in a preferred format (e.g., PDF, HTML).

### 5. Analysis and Reporting
- Review Nmap results: Check for open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
- Review Nikto results: Identify web server vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Review vulnerability scanner results: Analyze the findings and prioritize based on severity.

### 6. Remediation
- Patch and update: Apply necessary patches and updates to the web server, software, and services.
- Configuration changes: Implement recommended configuration changes to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
- Re-scan: Perform follow-up scans to ensure vulnerabilities have been addressed.

### 7. Documentation
- Create a report: Document the findings, remediation steps, and any remaining risks.
- Share with stakeholders: Provide the report to relevant stakeholders for review and action.

## Example Commands

### Nmap scan
```sh
nmap -sS -sV -O -p- -oN nmap_scan_results.txt <IP address>
